              <p>Everyone regardless of their ecocnomic status deserves access to fresh foods and groceries in general, yet this is often not the case in many urban communities beginning with my very own in Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis is just one of the many cities which has now become populated with food deserts in low-income, minority- filled areas.This is due to the removal of grocery stores in communities and the lack of resources to combat this which needs attention and action.</p>
